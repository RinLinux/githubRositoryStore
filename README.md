+ HomBlocks,HomBlocks is a new and highly efficient pipeline that used homologous blocks searching method to construct multi-gene alignment. It can automatically recognize locally collinear blocks (LCB) among organelle genomes and excavate phylogeny informative regions to construct multi-gene involved alignment in few hours.: https://github.com/fenghen360/HomBlocks
